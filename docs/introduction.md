# Introduction

### What is DekuSan?
DekuSan is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications, or "Dapps" in your normal Chrome browser!

The extension injects the DEXON web3 API (Ethereum compatible) into every website's javascript context, so that dapps can read from the blockchain.

DekuSan also lets the user create and manage their own identities, so when a Dapp wants to perform a transaction and write to the blockchain, the user gets a secure interface to review the transaction, before approving or rejecting it.
